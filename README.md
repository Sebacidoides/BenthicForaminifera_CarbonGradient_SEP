## Research's Abstract

The difference between the carbon isotopic composition between the calcareous test δ13C of Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi (δ13CCw) and Globobulimina species (δ13CGb) is directly related to the dissolved oxygen concentration in the bottom water (BWDO). This difference is known as the carbon gradient proxy, which can reconstruct bottom water oxygenation over the geological record. Calibrations for the proxy have been performed globally, including the Atlantic, North, and Equatorial Pacific oceans and the Arabian and Mediterranean seas, but lacking in the Southeast Pacific (SEP). Significant oxygen gradients characterize the SEP, which hosts one of the most important oxygen deleted zones in the world: the SEP-ODZ. We calibrated the carbon gradient proxy in the SEP using carbon isotope analyses of C. wuellerstorfi and Globobulimina species from 79 surface sediment samples covering from 4°N to 50°S and 124 to 3,960 m water depth. We complemented the Δδ13CCw-Gb with the difference between the bottom water dissolved inorganic carbon δ13CDIC and Globobulimina δ13CGb (Δδ13CDIC-Gb). Then, we compared the Δδ13CCw-Gb and Δδ13CDIC-Gb to BWDO at different water depths, assessing the effects of environmental factors like bottom water nitrate concentration (BWNO3-), carbonate ion concentration (BWCO32-), pH, and ocean net primary productivity. Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi δ13CCw is affected by BWCO32- and pH above 1,000 m, and primarily above 500 m. For Globobulimina species, BWNO3- seems to impact their δ13CGb above 500 m, while below 500 m, BWDO is the main driver. Consequently, we identified two proxies: one for depths below 1,000 m (R2 = 0.74), and another for depths 500–1,000 m (R2 = 0.67). Higher reliability was found at 500–1,000 m if only G. affinis is used (R2 = 0.72). The calibrated proxies extend the applicability of benthic foraminiferal δ13C to the SEP, providing a region-specific tool with worldwide potential for reconstructing past oceanic oxygenation, with an error of around ±14 µmol kg-1 for the reconstructed BWDO values.
